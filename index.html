        I am a creative and customer focused SCCM Specialist with a wide range of technical and non-technical skills, 
        and both BPSS (Baseline Personnel Security Standard) and SC (Security Check) security status. Within my permanent 
        and contract positions, I have delivered and facilitated key elements of major projects and infrastructure changes; 
        provided ongoing maintenance releases; and third line support. I have worked with Production environments of various 
        sizes (from approx. 7000 workstations at Marks & Spencer Plc to over 100,000 workstations at Johnson Controls Plc). 
        In addition to this, I am a director at GTB.technologies Ltd, a small company providing IT infrastructure & 
        application packaging expertise, and an accomplished photographer, working with well known brands such as Great 
        Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity and Marks & Spencer Plc, exhibiting nationally, and taking on weddings as
