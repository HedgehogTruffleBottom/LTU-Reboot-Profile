                    non-technical skills, and both BPSS (Baseline Personnel Security Standard) and SC (Security Check) security status.

                    changes; provided ongoing maintenance releases; and third line support. I have worked with Production environments 
                    of various sizes (from approx. 7000 workstations at Marks & Spencer Plc to over 100,000 workstations at Johnson Controls Plc).

                    In addition to this, I am a director at GTB.technologies Ltd, a small company providing IT infrastructure & 
                    application packaging expertise, and an accomplished photographer, working with well known brands such as Great 
                    Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, The Oppo Foundation, Fujitsu and Marks & Spencer Plc. My work has been exhibited

                    In my spare time, I write (I've been lucky enough to have work published), I'm an avid gamer (having taken part in UK trials 
                    of both Xbox Live and the Playstation Network), and I've recently rediscovered my childhood passion for model making.
