        <p>
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a customer focused SCCM Specialist (with Microsoft SCCM certification) with a wide range of technical and 
            non-technical skills, and both BPSS (Baseline Personnel Security Standard) and SC (Security Check) security status. 
            I have achieved both Prince2 Foundation and Practitioner certifications, as well as ITIL foundation. 
            <br>
            Within my permanent and contract positions, I have delivered and facilitated key elements of major projects and infrastructure 
            changes; provided ongoing maintenance releases; and third line support. I have worked with Production environments 
            of various sizes (from approx. 7000 workstations at Marks & Spencer Plc to over 100,000 workstations at Johnson Controls Plc). 
            <br>
            In addition to this, I am a director at GTB.technologies Ltd, a small company providing IT infrastructure & 
            application packaging expertise, and an accomplished photographer, working with well known brands such as Great 
            Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, The Oppo Foundation, Fujitsu and Marks & Spencer Plc. My work has been exhibited 
            nationally, and I regularly take on weddings, events and a variety of commercial and private commissions. 
            <br>
            In my spare time, I write (I've been lucky enough to have work published), I'm an avid gamer (having taken part in UK trials 
            of both Xbox Live and the Playstation Network), and I've recently rediscovered my childhood passion for model making.
